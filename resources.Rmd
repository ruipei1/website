### Tutorials

#### 1. How I build this site. 

I built this site using Rmarkdown. I was specifically looking for tools to build a personal website with the following considerations:

1. Simple: All I needed was to display some information on a static website. I was not planning on writing blogs.

2. Automated: such as being able to pull information from my google scholar page.

3. Easy to use.

I ended up building this site using Rstudio, inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template).
