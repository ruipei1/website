<div class="column-right">
My name is Rui (pronounced as "Ray") Pei, and I am a Ph.D candidate at the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://asc.upenn.edu) at University of Pennsylvania. My research centers around developmental neuroscience and health behavior. I am broadly interested in combining developmental neuroscience and communication research to promote healthy behavior in adolescents and young adults. 
<br>
<br>
I completed a B.Sc of Cognitive Neuroscience at Brown University. I completed an internship at the [Social Computing Group at Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/) between January and August, 2018.

More information about me can be found on my [Curriculum Vitae](files/cv_vitae.pdf) (last update `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %Y')`). 

I am interested in how peers and social network influence health decision making in adolescents. My recent studies invetigate how peer influence and social norms may be moderated by cultural background, and how specific social network stucutures (such as clustering structure) may play a role in adolescent risk taking behavior.
