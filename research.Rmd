<h4>Social influence and decision making</h4>
<br>


* How doneural responses to risks and type of peer influence (risky vs. safe) interact to influence adolescent risk taking?

* How does cultural background modulate developmental trajectory of susceptibility to peer influence?

* How does cultural collectivism influence people's COVID-related cognitions, as well as the growth rate of COVID-19?

<h4>Promoting social risk taking in adolescents</h4>

<br>

Adolescents across the world demonstrate increased risk taking behavior compared to adults. Although adolescent risk taking may lead to negative consequences such as motor vehicle accidents, tobacco use, and unsafe sexual behavior , recent studies highlight ways that risk taking during adolescence can be adaptive. Specifically, these studies indicate that increased risk taking behavior during adolescence is a normative developmental process that brings crucial opportunities for health promotion, academic achievements, social engagement, and life success (Crone & Dahl, 2012). As such, an important goal for parents, educators, and health practitioners is to effectively promote positive risk taking behaviors in adolescents.

<br>

This project focuses on one specific type of potentially positive risk taking behavior: social risk taking. First, social risk taking during adolescence is functionally adaptive as it facilitates the exploration of new social roles, creation of meaningful relationships, learning new skills, and engagement in other rewarding experiences; and 2) as adolescents start to spend more time with their friends than their parents, they are particularly sensitive to social cues (especially social rejection) and may particularly avoid social risk taking during this time period.

* Does our social network structure (i.e. clustering structure) influence risk taking behavior?

* Can we experimentally promote social risk taking in lab environment?
